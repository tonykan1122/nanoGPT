## Model Architecture Exploration
My SID 1155181978(XYZ mod 4 = 2)\
Remainder 2: Layers = 7, Heads âˆˆ {2, 3, 5, 7}

The validation losses at iteration 40:
- 2 heads: 2.5452
- 3 heads: 2.5456
- 5 heads: 2.5458
- 7 heads: 2.5441

Thus, the lowest validation loss I achieved is 2.5441 with settings:\
Layers = 7 \
Head = 7 \
Iteration = 40

My favorite coherent code snippet:
```c
pIter->pNext;
pIter->pNext = pTrue->pNext;
if( pIter->pNext && pIter->apPatter->pNext ){
  assert( pPatter->aNode[pIter->apNext );
     pIter->apNext;
  }
}
}
}

pIter->apPatter[pIter->aiPathOffset = pIter->appList[pIter->zPath];
pIter->azColumn[pIter->apPath->nNext++] = pIter->apPath[pIter->apPath[pIter->aiPaye];
pIter->aiCol[pIter->aiPathOffset] = (int)pIter->aiIdx[iIdx]->aiColumn[ii];
return SQLITE_OK;
```
As it demonstrates how the model has learned C pointer and its manipulation patterns.
